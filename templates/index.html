<h2>About</h2>

<p>Conredet detects cells and signals within confocal microscope 3D images.</p>

<p>Input image should have one layer of nearly-circular cells having most of
their volume visible in at least one channel. Image shour contain one channel
for chromosome territories of arbitrary shape and several channels for tiny
(less than wavelength) signals. For either a fixed volume in pixels is assumed.</p>

<p>As a result conredet produces tables with cell locations, signals and
territories locations and sizes and their mutual distances within each cell.
The only significant difference between signals and territories is in the way
distances are calculated: for territories border-to-border distance is computed
while for signals the distance between geometrical centers seems more reasonable.</p>
