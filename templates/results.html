		<p>Fields in CSV files have the following meanings:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>cell_n</dt>
			<dd>Cell number. Unique within image.</dd>

			<dt>color, color1, color2</dt>
			<dd>Color of signal / territory / cell. (Cell color is always either of
			red2, green2, blue2).</dd>

			<dt>spot, spot1, spot2</dt>
			<dd>Number of signal of this color. Pair signal color + signal number is
			unique within image.</dd>

			<dt>x, y, z</dt>
			<dd>Coordinates of estimated center of mass of the object (signal /
			territory / cell). Unit: pixels.</dd>

			<dt>size</dt>
			<dd>Size of the object. Unit: voxels. This value is precise, but not
			comparable between images.</dd>

			<dt>volume</dt>
			<dd>Size of the object. Unit: nm<sup>3</sup>. This value is comparable
			between images.</dd>

			<dt>distance</dt>
			<dd>Three-dimensional pixel distance between centers of mass of two
			objects. Unit: pixels. This value is not comparable between images.</dd>

			<dt>physical_distance</dt>
			<dd>Three-dimensional distance between centers of mass of two objects.
			Unit: nm. This value is comparable between images.</dd>

			<dt>onion_distance</dt>
			<dd>Two-dimensional distance between borders of two signals. Unit: nm. To
			obtain this value we either extend or shrink a signal by one pixel in all
			directions until it overlaps both presense and absense of pixels of color
			of the othe signal. The value is calculated from the number of layers
			added/removed. Hence the title: onion distance. The distance is
			very discreet and noisy. This value is comparable between images.
			<p>WARNING! For line with green1 red2 an onion distance of 2 means the
			closest green signal from red2 is 2nm away. green1 may actually be a lot
			further.</p>
			<p>There are two special values here.</p>
			<p>-1 means the distance is too large to be worth computing (the
			threshold is 20 pixels&nbsp;&mdash; computation get really slow with
			larger values and in practice this usually means that there is no
			detected usable pair).</p>
			<p>-2 means that distance between the two given colors is not computed
			(currently only distances to red color are computed.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>ellipsoid_distance</dt>
			<dd>Two-dimensional distance between borders of two signals. Unit: nm. To
			obtain this value we find the smallest ellipsoid with the center of the
			first signal that overlaps the second signal. (More precisely: until it
			overlaps both presense and absense of pixels of color of the other signal).
			The ellipsoid has equal axes when measured in phisical units, so actually
			it is a sphere. The value is the radius of the sphere. The distance is
			very discreet and noisy. This value is comparable between images.
			<p>WARNING! For line with green1 red2 an onion distance of 2 means the
			closest green signal from red2 is 2nm away. green1 may actually be a lot
			further.</p>
			<p>There are two special values here.</p>
			<p>-1 means the distance is too large to be worth computing (the

			detected usable pair).</p>
			<p>-2 means that distance between the two given colors is not computed
			(currently only distances to red color are computed.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>overlap</dt>
			<dd>Overlap between the two signals. Unit: voxels. This value is not
			comparable between images with different resolution.</dd>

			<dt>overlap_volume</dt>
			<dd>Overlap between the two signals. Unit: nm<sup>3</sup>. This value is
			comparable between images with different resolution.</dd>

			<dt>spot_distance, spot_overlap</dt>
			<dd>Distance (physical) / overlap (volume) between the two spots
			mentioned.</dd>

			<dt>territory_distance, territory_overlap</dt>
			<dd>Distance (onion) / overlap (volume) between spot1 mentioned and the
			nearest territory(ies).</dd>
