		<h2>Explanation</h2>

		<p>Fields in CSV files have the following meanings:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>cell_n</dt>
			<dd>Cell number. Unique within image.</dd>

			<dt>color, color1, color2</dt>
			<dd>Color of signal / territory / cell. (Cell color is always either of
			red2, green2, blue2).</dd>

			<dt>spot, spot1, spot2</dt>
			<dd>Number of signal of this color. Pair signal color + signal number is
			unique within image.</dd>

			<dt>x, y, z</dt>
			<dd>Coordinates of estimated center of mass of the object (signal /
			territory / cell). Unit: pixels.</dd>

			<dt>size</dt>
			<dd>Size of the object. Unit: voxels. This value is precise, but not
			comparable between images.</dd>

			<dt>volume</dt>
			<dd>Size of the object. Unit: nm<sup>3</sup>. This value is comparable
			between images.</dd>

			<dt>distance</dt>
			<dd>Three-dimensional pixel distance between centers of mass of two
			objects. Unit: pixels. This value is not comparable between images.</dd>

			<dt>physical_distance</dt>
			<dd>Three-dimensional distance between centers of mass of two objects.
			Unit: nm. This value is comparable between images.</dd>

			<dt>onion_distance</dt>
			<dd>Two-dimensional distance between borders of two signals. Unit: nm. To
			obtain this value we either extend or shrink a signal by one pixel in all
			directions until it overlaps both presense and absense of pixels of color
			of the othe signal. The value is number of layers added/removed. Hence
			the title: onion distance. Note: this is distance to the nearest signal
			of given color, not exactly to the signal2 in the table. The distance is
			very discreet and noisy. This value is comparable between images.</dd>
